On Yesterday: 

1. After standup me and Bilal had session where Bilal walk me through artchitectral

overview of backend / frontend layers and how api are exposed and call through diffrent layers

2. Also he discussed about the next task that I nedd to work at.

3. Later on I cloned the sas-adu-mobility git repo to my local machine for non workbench services development.

Unfortunatel not able to run it locally as need a configuration files that Bilal is aware of
And he is gonna help me out in this regard.

In after noon I took a session with Osama where I walk him through questionnaire,

and how we can create and configure a questionnaire.

Also we had internal meeting with devs where we discussed about journey global context creation and how
we can import relevant initial states variable from a service and make it availble to another service to consume those data.


Today: I will be working on integrating our questionnaire and service that we work at so far in a journey.

And then as soon as I get the .env config file I will proceed with the non workbench service.

so yeh thats pretty much. Thanks.

Impediments: .env file
